# Flux Theme

Welcome to **Flux Theme** for VS Code-compatible editors including **VS Code**, **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **Antigravity**, and other Code OSS builds _(via Open VSX)_.

Pick the variant that fits your focus:

- **`Flux Night`** — A dark theme featuring a neutral palette, designed to minimize distractions and keep your focus squarely on the code.
- **`Flux Twilight`** — A rich dark theme with a vibrant violet base, offering a more expressive and colorful alternative to traditional neutral themes.
- **`Flux Dawn`** — A warm light theme featuring a vibrant orange primary, creating an energetic and inspiring atmosphere to kickstart your day.
- **`Flux Daylight`** — A clean light theme with a neutral palette, designed for maximum clarity and focus during daytime coding sessions.

## 🔠 Fonts

For the optimal look, I suggest using these fonts: **Fira Code**, **Consolas**, **Courier New**, **Monospace**, or any other monospaced font that you love.
If you don’t have them, feel free to use your favorite!

#### Set Fonts

1. Open your `settings.json` file
2. Locate the `"editor.fontFamily"` setting and update it to your preferred fonts

```json
"editor.fontFamily": "Fira Code, Consolas, Courier New, monospace",
```
